# Annotator guide

This page provides a guide for annotators to use the annotation tool. The annotation tool is a web-based tool for annotating collections of documents.

To get started, sign into the project you were invited to. On the left tab, select "Everyone's Tasks" to see a list of documentas that still need annotating. Depending on how your research lead is running the project, you may see some tasks assigned to you already, or you may note that there are a large number of "UNASSIGNED" tasks.
  - If you see a task assigned to you, you can get started by clicking the "Go to annotation screen" link on the right side of the task.
  - If you've been instructed to claim an "UNASSIGNED" tasks, you can assign that task to yourself by clicking the "Claim task" button on the right side of the task.

This will bring you to the annotation screen. The left half of the annotation screen shows the contents of a collection of documents, the right half of the screen shows a list of questions you need to answer about those documents.

To annotate a document, select a question from the list on the right. The question will expand to show a list of options. Read over the documents on the left side of the screen, and highlight any text that corresponds to the question you've selected. Once you've highlighted all relevant text, select the best answer or answers from the list of options, and rate your confidence in your answer.

To save your work, press ctrl+s or cmd+s on your keyboard. You can also click the "Save" button at the bottom of the screen.

Several users requested that we always include a warning before closing the page. This feature exists because you may want to keep the browser tab with your annotation open, for example if you plan to be offline and want to work on the annotation while offline. If you've saved recently and don't see a "current work is not saved" warning at the bottom of the screen, you should be safe to close the tab.

## Tips and Tricks

**bookmarks**. You'll note that some questions are grouped into categories. When highlighting, you can click in the margin on the right of any paragraph to set a bookmark, which add a small tag to your scrollbar that you can use to quickly navigate to that part of the document. Bookmarks are shared across all options in the same category.

**navigating the question list**. At the bottom of the screen is a small progress bar, broken into chunks by question category. As you answer questions the chunk of the progress bar corresponding to the question will fill as you select answers and adjust your confidence. You can click on the progress bar to quickly navigate to the corresponding question. You can also click the "current question" to scroll to the currently selected question, and "Next unanswered question" to scroll to the earliest question you haven't answered yet.

**navigating the document collection**. At the bottom of the document viewer is a list of letters or numbers. Mouse over these items to view a document name, and click to jump to that document.

**working offline**. If you find youself annotating a document while not connected to the internet, you can save your work to your browser by scrolling to the very bottom of the quesiton list and clicking the `[Danger!] Offline Save` button. One you click "OK" on the popup, you can safely close the browser tab or turn off your computer. Once you're back online, scroll back to the bottom of the question list and click the `[Danger!] Restore Last Offline Save` button to restore your work. **NOTE: this will overwrite any work you've done since your last offline save.**
